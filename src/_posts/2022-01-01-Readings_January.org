title: Readings January 2022
summary: Things I read in January 2022
---

I've decided note down the things I read every month - especially those I find interesting.

Each item has a summary along with it, as well as tags, depending on what it is related to. A 📝 marks a paper,
a 📚 marks a book, and 🌐 represents a site/blog.

It isn't uncommon for me to skim something, rather than reading it thoroughly. This gives me an idea
of the topic at hand, but not in-depth knowledge. I note them here, marked with a ⏩ sign.

This page will grow week-by-week till February, when I will start another page.


    - 📚 ⏩ *[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112252.Types_and_Programming_Languages][Types and Programming Languages]]*  \\
      This book, roughly, defines what type is, and tells how types are useful. This is followed by instructions
      of how to define the syntax and semantics of languages, and how to type languages. I only read this upto
      7-8 chapters - most of the content has already been covered in my undergraduate courses.
      /[tags:types, programming-languages]/

      
    - 🌐 *[[https://chaidarun.com/ten-years-of-logging-my-life][Ten Years of Logging My Life]]* \\
      An interesting blog post on recording day-to-day patterns and analyzing them.
      /[tags:self-improvement, logging]/

      
    - 🌐 ⏩ *[[http://notebook.kulchenko.com/programming/lua-good-different-bad-and-ugly-parts][Lua: Good, bad, and ugly parts]]* \\
      A blog post on various aspects of Lua - I don't know the language yet, but I read it to see if I want to learn it, or not.
      I think I do.
      /[tags:programming-languages, lua, learning]/

      
    - 🌐 ⏩ *[[https://marc.info/?l=git&m=124111702609723&w=2][Why git is so fast]]* \\
      Some of the optimizations git makes. Has special focus on why C is the language of choice (rather than, say, Java).
      /[tags:programming-languages, optimization, git, learning]/

      
    - 🌐 *[[https://outerproduct.net/2021-02-13_att-asm.html][Why no one should use the AT&T syntax ever, for any reason, under any circumstances]]*\\
      An opinion piece on why AT&T assembly syntax is confusing and poorly designed. A fun read.
      /[tags:assembly, rant]/


    - 📚 *[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25135194-prisoners-of-geography][Prisoners of Geography]]* \\
      A book I received as a gift - on geopolitics. It explains, in layperson terms, the complex political situations of various countries. Of course, as
      you might have figured out, there's special focus on how geography plays a part in influencing the actions of every nation. This book
      was a great read, and a great gift from [[https://github.com/santwanav/][Santwana]].

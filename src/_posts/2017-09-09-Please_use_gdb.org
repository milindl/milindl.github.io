title: Please Use GDB
summary: An opinion/experience post on why `gdb` is highly recommended to everyone.
---

/What this is not/: a complete guide to `gdb`. There are plenty of those
online, and I link several of them at the end. This is primarily an
opinion/experience piece on why /I/ find `gdb` to be essential. There
is /some/ usage instruction, but that is to enable anyone to follow along.

The first programming language - or indeed, even the second one - I learnt
was not C/C++. I never had to allocate any memory manually, or face any
of those pesky segmentation faults. I had my friend the trust GC with me,
and I was happy.

I first learnt C by bits-and-pieces -- in school, online, and finally, as a
part of my academic curriculum at IIT Kanpur. At all those times, I found it
to be tedious, boring, and needlessly hard to debug. I convinced myself that
I'd never ever use it.
